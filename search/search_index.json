Underneath this layer lie several lower-level functions which can provide us additional control. Here we'll query the retrieve_electricity_consumption end-point and extract the JSON response. r = download_manager . retrieve_electricity_consumption ( meter_mpan = meter_mpan , meter_serial = meter_serial ) r . json () . keys () dict_keys(['count', 'next', 'previous', 'results']) We can use another octopyenergy helper function, response_to_data to convert the response into a dataframe. N.b. this will only work for responses which can be converted into a dataframe, such as those from retrieve_electricity_consumption and retrieve_gas_consumption . s_elec_consumption = oe . api . results_to_df ( r . json ()[ 'results' ]) s_elec_consumption . head () interval_start consumption 2020-10-27 23:00:00+00:00 0.008 2020-10-27 22:30:00+00:00 0.007 2020-10-27 22:00:00+00:00 0.008 2020-10-27 21:30:00+00:00 0.008 2020-10-27 21:00:00+00:00 0.007 The deepest abstraction level is available through the query_endpoint method, this provides access to all of the end-points but requires a larger number of parameters to be passed.
